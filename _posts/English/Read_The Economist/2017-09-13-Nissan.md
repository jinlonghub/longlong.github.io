##新闻原文     

Nissan has launched a new longer-ranged version of its Leaf electric car that can be driven by just one “e-Pedal” for both accelerating and braking.        
The new Leaf can travel up to 235 miles between charges under European driving conditions and can be fully charged in 40 minutes with fast chargers,     
although electric cars typically run 20-25% shorter distances under real-world driving conditions.
